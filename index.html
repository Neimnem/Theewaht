        UAKSJDAKS WHY DID SHE DIEEE

        “The girl was dead. If her lifeless body had not confirmed it, 
        then it would have been made clear by the horrible scream of the 
        Fate who held her in his arms. The story curse was familiar with pain, 
        but this was agony, the sort of raw grief that was only seen once in a century. 
        The Fate was every tear that anyone had ever shed for lost love. He was pain given form.”
        ― Stephanie Garber, The Ballad of Never After
